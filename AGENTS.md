## What this project is

`mermaid2pptx` converts a Mermaid-rendered SVG (or a `.mmd` file, via
`mermaid-cli`) into a PowerPoint `.pptx` made of **native, editable objects** —
preset shapes, connectors bound to those shapes, and text boxes. It is not an
image exporter. The goal is that a user can open the result in PowerPoint and
move/edit every element.

Read `README.md` for user-facing behavior before changing conversion output.

## Build, test, verify

```sh
go build -o mermaid2pptx ./cmd/mermaid2pptx   # build
go test ./...                                 # unit + package tests
go vet ./... && gofmt -l .                    # must be clean (gofmt prints nothing)
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /dev/null ./cmd/mermaid2pptx  # cross-compile check
```

Always run `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`, and `go test ./...` before finishing a
change. If a change affects the generated `.pptx`, also verify the output (see
below) — a well-formed XML test passing does not prove the slide looks right.

### Verifying generated output

Tests already assert: element counts per sample, node-shape kinds, connector
endpoint geometry, and that every packaged XML part is well-formed and no shape
lands off-slide. When you change the generator, re-run the samples and inspect
with `python-pptx` (available in the environment):

```sh
./mermaid2pptx -f sample/graph*.svg
python3 -c "from pptx import Presentation; p=Presentation('sample/graph1.pptx'); print(len(p.slides[0].shapes))"
```

The strongest check we have is `TestConnectorEndpointsMatchSVG`, which
reconstructs every edge connector's endpoints from the generated XML (undoing
the flip/rotation) and asserts they match the SVG `data-points` transformed
through the same px->EMU fit, within ~1 EMU. `fitTransform` in `slide.go` is
the single source of truth for that transform, shared by the generator and the
test. If you touch geometry, this test is the guard — keep it green.

## Architecture

Pipeline: **parse SVG → `Diagram` model → emit `slide1.xml` (DrawingML) → zip
into a `.pptx`**. The CLI only wires files together and, for `.mmd`, shells out
to `mmdc` to produce a temporary SVG first.

- `cmd/mermaid2pptx/main.go` — flags, `.mmd`→SVG rendering (`mmdc`), file I/O.
- `internal/convert/model.go` — the intermediate types: `Diagram`, `Node`,
  `Cluster`, `Edge`, `EdgeLabel`, `Line`, `TextBox`, plus `ShapeKind`. Also the
  Mermaid default theme colors.
- `internal/convert/svg.go` — the shared parser. `ParseMermaidSVG` detects the
  diagram type from the root `aria-roledescription` and dispatches.
  `parseGraphDiagram` handles the dagre-based types (flowchart, state, class,
  er) that share the `nodes / edgePaths / edgeLabels / clusters` DOM.
- `internal/convert/compartment.go` — class/ER boxes (title/member/attribute
  compartments) decomposed into a box + text boxes + divider lines.
- `internal/convert/sequence.go` — the sequence diagram parser (flat layout of
  rects, lines, and text; text is attached to the smallest enclosing rect).
- `internal/convert/geom.go` — connector placement math: which side an edge
  leaves/enters, and the flip/rotate transform to fit a preset connector.
- `internal/convert/slide.go` — DrawingML emission (`GenerateSlideXML`) and the
  px→EMU transform. `Options` holds font + margin.
- `internal/convert/skeleton.go` — the static parts of the `.pptx` package
  (everything except `slide1.xml`) and the zip writer.

### Coordinate systems

- SVG pixels, y-down. The viewBox origin (`MinX`/`MinY`) can be non-zero
  (sequence diagrams) — always subtract it.
- EMU for OOXML: `9525 EMU = 1 px` at 96 dpi; slide is 12192000 x 6858000 EMU.
- Composite states and other nested content live inside a translated
  `<g class="root">`; the parser accumulates ancestor `translate()` while
  walking, and each `parseX` takes `dx, dy` offsets. Do not assume a node's
  transform is absolute.

## Conventions

- **Standard library only.** No production dependencies. Do not add a module
  require without asking the user first. (`python-pptx` and `mermaid-cli` are
  external *dev/verify* tools, not Go deps.)
- Code comments in English. Keep them at the density of the surrounding code
  and explain *why*, not *what*.
- Prefer small, focused functions that append to the `Diagram` model; keep XML
  string-building confined to `slide.go` / `skeleton.go`.
- Emitted XML is built with `fmt.Fprintf` into a `strings.Builder`; always run
  user text through `xmlEsc`.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Mermaid's DOM changes between versions.** Samples were rendered with
  mermaid-cli 11.15. Shapes are detected structurally, not by a fixed path —
  e.g. stadium nodes are a `<g>`-wrapped Bézier `<path>`, not a rect; the
  diamond `<polygon>` carries its own `translate()` on top of the node's.
  When output breaks after a mermaid upgrade, re-inspect the SVG structure
  before "fixing" the code.
- **Some line ends have no OOXML equivalent** (hollow inheritance triangle,
  crow's foot). They are deliberately approximated in `arrowType`.
- **Preset connectors can't express every route.** U-turns and multi-bend
  paths fall back to a freeform polyline; endpoints stay exact but the curve
  differs from Mermaid.
- Edge endpoints are resolved first from the edge id (`L_from_to_n` /
  `id_from_to_n`), then by nearest-boundary geometry — node ids may contain
  underscores, so id splitting is validated against the known-id set.

## Adding a new diagram type

1. Render a sample with `mmdc` and inspect the SVG structure (root
   `aria-roledescription`, node/edge classes, whether it uses `data-points`).
2. If it is dagre-based (shares `nodes`/`edgePaths`), extend `parseGraphDiagram`
   and reuse the existing node/edge parsing. Otherwise write a dedicated parser
   like `sequence.go`.
3. Map its shapes to `ShapeKind` / `Line` / `TextBox` in the model; add
   rendering in `slide.go` only if a new geometry is needed.
4. Add a `sample/graphN.mmd`, render it, and add a `TestParseGraphN` plus the
   file to `TestGeneratePackage`.

## Repository notes

- `_sandbox/` holds internal material and is git-ignored — never commit it or
  copy its contents into tracked files or generated output.
- `sample/*.svg` are test fixtures (referenced by the tests); `sample/*.mmd`
  are their sources; `sample/*.pptx` are demonstration outputs. Keep them in
  sync when you change the generator.
- Do not include customer names, account numbers, or other PII in code,
  samples, or generated artifacts.
