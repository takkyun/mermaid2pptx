# mermaid2pptx

*Read this in [日本語](README.ja.md).*

A CLI tool that converts Mermaid diagrams into `.pptx` files made of
**editable PowerPoint objects** (shapes, connectors, and text) — not a
flattened image. (This is not an official mermaid-js project.)

Supported diagrams: **flowchart / stateDiagram-v2 / classDiagram / erDiagram /
sequenceDiagram** (auto-detected from the SVG root's `aria-roledescription`).

Implemented with the Go standard library only, so it cross-compiles to a
single binary for macOS / Windows. Input is either the SVG that Mermaid emits
(no dependencies) or a `.mmd` file (rendered to SVG by calling the
`mermaid-cli` found on `PATH`).

## Layout

```
cmd/mermaid2pptx/ CLI entry point
internal/convert/ SVG parser, DrawingML generation, PPTX packaging
sample/           samples (.mmd / .svg rendered by mermaid-cli /
                  .pptx produced by this tool)
```

Sample coverage:

- graph1 — flowchart LR; full node-shape coverage (stadium, parallelogram,
  diamond, subroutine, circle, cylinder, hexagon); reverse edges; thick edge
- graph2 — flowchart with nested subgraphs; dotted edges; DB cylinder
- graph3 — flowchart with `classDef` colors; cyclic edges; edge labels
- graph4 — flowchart `%%{init}%%` (curve: basis / wrappingWidth); long-label
  auto-wrapping; a diamond gate standing between two clusters
- graph5 — stateDiagram-v2 (start/end states, composite state, transition labels)
- graph6 — sequenceDiagram (actors, lifelines, activation, note, dashed replies)
- graph7 — classDiagram (interface, realization, aggregation)
- graph8 — erDiagram (entity attribute tables, cardinality)

## Build

```sh
go build -o mermaid2pptx ./cmd/mermaid2pptx

# For Windows
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mermaid2pptx.exe ./cmd/mermaid2pptx
```

## Usage

```sh
./mermaid2pptx input.svg              # write input.pptx (won't overwrite an existing file)
./mermaid2pptx input.mmd              # convert straight from .mmd via mmdc
./mermaid2pptx -f input.svg           # allow overwriting
./mermaid2pptx -o out.pptx input.svg  # set the output path
./mermaid2pptx a.svg b.mmd            # convert several at once (mixed input is fine)
./mermaid2pptx -font "Meiryo" a.svg   # set the font (default: Noto Sans JP)
./mermaid2pptx -margin 0.5 a.svg      # slide margin in inches (default: 0.3)
./mermaid2pptx -mmdc /path/to/mmdc a.mmd  # point at a specific mermaid-cli
./mermaid2pptx -version               # print version information and exit

# Regenerate the samples
./mermaid2pptx -f sample/graph*.svg
```

Options may appear before, after, or between the input files
(`./mermaid2pptx a.svg -o out.pptx -f` works too).

`.mmd` input requires [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
(`npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`). SVG input has no external
dependencies.

## Rendering the sample SVGs

`sample/*.svg` is produced with mermaid-cli:

```sh
mmdc -i sample/graph1.mmd -o sample/graph1.svg -I my-svg -b white
```

## Conversion rules

Common:

- Slides are 16:9 (13.33 x 7.5 in). The whole diagram is fit into the margins
  with its aspect ratio preserved, and the font is scaled by the same factor
  (small diagrams are enlarged up to 1.25x).
- Fill, stroke, and text colors are carried over from the SVG styles verbatim.
- `<br/>` becomes a paragraph break; `<b>` / `<i>` become bold / italic.

flowchart / stateDiagram:

- Nodes map to PowerPoint preset shapes:
  - rectangle `[ ]` / subroutine → `roundRect`
  - diamond `{ }` → `diamond`
  - cylinder `[( )]` → `can`
  - circle `(( ))` / start & end states → `ellipse`
  - stadium `([ ])` → `roundRect` (fully rounded corners)
  - hexagon `{{ }}` → `hexagon`
  - other polygons (parallelogram `[/ /]`, etc.) → custom geometry (vertices
    emitted as-is)
- Edges become PowerPoint connectors (`curvedConnector2/3` /
  `straightConnector1`). The endpoints are bound to the nodes (composite
  states to the container) via `stCxn` / `endCxn`, so moving a shape drags its
  connectors along. Routes that no preset can express fall back to a freeform
  polyline.
- Edge labels → rounded rectangles with no border and a translucent background.
- Subgraphs / composite states → rounded rectangles with a top-anchored title.
- Dotted edges (`-.->`) become dashed; thick edges (`==>`) become thick lines.

classDiagram / erDiagram:

- A class / entity becomes one outer rectangle + independent text boxes
  (title, members, attribute rows) placed at the same positions as in the SVG
  + divider lines.
- Relationships become connectors (`stCxn` / `endCxn` bound). Arrowheads are
  approximated with OOXML line ends: inheritance/realization `<|--` → filled
  triangle, composition/aggregation `*--` / `o--` → diamond, dependency → open
  arrow, crow's foot `}o` / `}|` → open arrow, `|o` → oval.

sequenceDiagram:

- Actor boxes / activations / notes → rectangles (with their text pulled in).
- Lifelines → thin lines; messages → arrowed straight lines (dashed replies
  supported).
- Message labels → borderless text boxes (width estimated from the font).

## Limitations

- Assumes Mermaid `htmlLabels` (foreignObject labels); sequence uses SVG text.
- Edge curves are approximated by preset connectors and do not exactly match
  Mermaid's Bézier curves (the endpoints do match).
- Line ends with no OOXML equivalent (hollow inheritance triangle, crow's
  foot) are approximated.
- In class / ER diagrams the compartment text is separate from its box, so
  moving the box leaves the text behind (grouping is a future task).
- Sequence loop / alt frames go through the generic conversion (lines + text);
  there is no dedicated handling for them.
